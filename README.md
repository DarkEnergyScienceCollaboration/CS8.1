#  Parameterization of the mock catalogs for DC2 and DC3

Summary -- Develop the tools and the validation of the various prescriptions for generating mock catalogs
including appropriate colors, sizes, morphologies and correlations with density ( based on the requirements
defined in DC1).

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS8.1.1 ( 03/17 ): Gather the requirements on parameter distributions from the relevant working
groups.
* Key Task CS8.1.2 ( 03/17 ): Develop the tools necessary to validate the mock catalogs.
* Key Task CS8.1.3 ( 03/17 ): Produce a validation document showing that requirements on
the distributions are met by the mock catalogs

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
